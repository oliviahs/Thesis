# Reducing the STEM Gender Gap 
#### The Effect of Psychological Interventions on the Social Networks and Academic Persistence of Women Ph.D. Students in STEM
Can there be a treatment for bridging the gender gap in STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics) fields? This study demonstrates that psychological interventions
can be effective in promoting women STEM Ph.D. studentsâ€™ persistence in school. Multilevel
model analyses suggested that female students (but not male) who received a values affirmation
or social belonging intervention were nine percentage points more likely to remain in their
graduate program after 3-4 years than those who were not treated. The social belonging
intervention was effective for both women and men in helping them persist in STEM Ph.D.
programs, with the odds of retention increased by 2.29 times compared to the control condition.
These findings indicate the importance of providing psychological support for female STEM
Ph.D. students to reduce gender disparities in STEM.
