# Reducing the STEM Gender Gap 
### The Effect of Psychological Interventions on the Social Networks and Academic Persistence of Women Ph.D. Students in STEM
This study reveals the efficacy of psychological interventions in supporting women pursuing STEM Ph.D. degrees. Multilevel model analyses suggested that female students who received a values affirmation or social belonging intervention were 9 percentage points more likely to remain in their graduate program after 3-4 years than those who were not treated. This indicates the importance of providing psychological support for female STEM Ph.D. students to reduce gender disparities in STEM.
